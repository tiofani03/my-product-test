# MyProduct
A simple application based on the provided case study.

### Overview
This application is developed using various technologies and libraries, Coroutine and Dagger Hilt.

### Architecture
A simple application based on the provided case study, implementing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture along with the repository pattern. The MVVM architecture promotes a separation of concerns, enhancing code maintainability and testability. Additionally, the repository pattern is employed to manage data access, providing a centralized and organized approach to handling data retrieval and storage.

### Unit testing with mockk
This application employs the MockK library for unit testing to ensure robust and reliable code. The use of MockK facilitates the creation of mock objects, allowing for isolated testing of individual components. 
This approach enhances the overall quality of the application by verifying the correctness of each unit of code.
